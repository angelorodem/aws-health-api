This project is a simple API that returns health information from several different AWS services, using only one lambda function.

It is recommended to use authentication with AWS Cognito at the endpoint of this API to avoid information leakage

The current Code expects a GET input called key (`? Key =`) to authenticate with the environment variable, as the key is fixed, the use of https is extremely necessary.

| incompatible-network                | Amazon RDS is attempting to perform a recovery action on a DB instance but can't do so because the VPC is in a state that prevents the action from being completed. This status can occur if, for example, all available IP addresses in a subnet are in use and Amazon RDS can't get an IP address for the DB instance.                                                          |
| incompatible-option-group           | Amazon RDS attempted to apply an option group change but can't do so, and Amazon RDS can't roll back to the previous option group state. For more information, check the Recent Events list for the DB instance. This status can occur if, for example, the option group contains an option such as TDE and the DB instance doesn't contain encrypted information.                |
| incompatible-parameters             | Amazon RDS can't start the DB instance because the parameters specified in the DB instance's DB parameter group aren't compatible with the DB instance. Revert the parameter changes or make them compatible with the DB instance to regain access to your DB instance. For more information about the incompatible parameters, check the Recent Events list for the DB instance. |
| incompatible-restore                | Amazon RDS can't do a point-in-time restore. Common causes for this status include using temp tables, using MyISAM tables with MySQL, or using Aria tables with MariaDB.                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| maintenance                         | Amazon RDS is applying a maintenance update to the DB instance. This status is used for instance-level maintenance that RDS schedules well in advance.                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| modifying                           | The DB instance is being modified because of a customer request to modify the DB instance.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

| rebooting                           | The DB instance is being rebooted because of a customer request or an Amazon RDS process that requires the rebooting of the DB instance.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

| storage-full                        | The DB instance has reached its storage capacity allocation. This is a critical status, and we recommend that you fix this issue immediately. To do so, scale up your storage by modifying the DB instance. To avoid this situation, set Amazon CloudWatch alarms to warn you when storage space is getting low.                                                                  |
| storage-optimization                | Your DB instance is being modified to change the storage size or type. The DB instance is fully operational. However, while the status of your DB instance is storage-optimization, you can't request any changes to the storage of your DB instance. The storage optimization process is usually short, but can sometimes take up to and even beyond 24 hours.                   |
| upgrading                           | The database engine version is being upgraded.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
